Cyberball is a virtual ball-toss game that can be used for research on ostracism, social exclusion or rejection. It has also been used to study discrimination and prejudice. Four players (three computer controlled and one human) play a game of tossing a ball around. After a set number of throws two of the computer-controlled players will both start to ignore another computer-controlled player.

    Uses vector-based graphics for high visual fidelity.
    Ball behavior during throw has visual distinct spin, height, and speed.
    All throws can be balanced prior to the exclusion phase (i.e each bot receives similar number of throws).
    The switch to the exclusion phase can be based on player behavior (minimum throws) or bot behavior (equal throws to all players).
    A pause can be introduced on similar criteria.
    Includes a small practice.
    Allows the player to input name and select gloves.
    Names of players and faces differ based on the gender of the participant.
